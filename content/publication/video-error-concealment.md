abstract = "This paper summarizes the development of a high performance video codec with error concealment. The key idea is a systematic search for similar blocks in the neighborhood of the damaged blocks. The proposed idea has been integrated with the H264 reference codec known as JM and extensive experiments clearly demonstrated the performance of the new approach."
