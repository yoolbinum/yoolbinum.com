abstract = "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in military and industry today is becoming more widespread. There are a wide range of UAV models taht are functional today. The size of these UAVs can be as small as a hawk and can be even as big as a passenger jetliner. It is critical for these UAVs to have contingency plans before flight in case of unexpected situations such as engine-out events which cause total loss of thrust during flight. An important part of the contingency planning is to identify emergency landing sites along the flight path of the UAV. This paper discusses the development of an off-line automated approach for finding emergency landing sites in the shape of a rectangular runway to be used in preflight contingency planning. The approach introduces a total of five emergency landing measures and surface type estimation which are applied to the identified emergency landing site candidates for their safety assessment. The output is a list of emergency landing site candidates together with their surface type estimates that are ranked from the safest to least safe through a generalized safety ranking score. The approach is automated starting from the retrieval of the color satellite and elevation images of the geographical area interest up to the point where these images are processed using image processing and machine learning techniques. Safety rankings of the landing site candidates are also generated for each surface type."
